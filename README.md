# Programming in Psychology Class Exercises

Welcome to the repository of completed exercises for my Programming in Psychology class. This course covered fundamental coding practices and computational tools frequently used in psychology research, providing hands-on experience with coding experiments, data analysis, and visualization.

## Course Description

Modern psychology labs resemble tech offices and startups, filled with researchers coding behind computers. In this course, we will cover fundamental coding practices and computational tools commonly used in psychology research. Topics include:

- Basics of coding
- Coding up experiments
- Keeping a digital lab notebook
- Univariate data analyses
- Visualization through programming

Through this process, students will develop and run a simple experiment from start to finish. This course is ideal for students considering or beginning a thesis, those interested in graduate school, or those seeking more experience in data science or programming.

**Prerequisites:** PSYC 101, PSYC 210 (or equivalent courses)

## Course Objectives

- Use two programs commonly used in psychological research: Python and R
- Understand and apply the basics of coding to create simple functions
- Apply class concepts directly to a psychology project, immediately implementing what you've learned in a research setting
- Collaborate productively with peers, a key aspect of programming in both lab and company environments
