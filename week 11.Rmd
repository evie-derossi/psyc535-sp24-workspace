This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Practice Problem 1}
my_vec <- c(1,3,4,5,10)
for (idx in c(1:5)){
  my_vec[idx] <- my_vec[idx] +5
}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

#Data Frames
```{r creating a data frame}
part_names <- c("Ellen", "Ari", "Mark", "Yumi")
pizza <- c(3,6,2,5)
df <- data.frame(name = part_names, slices = pizza)

df$slices*2
paste("kid", df$name)
df$leftovers<-df$slices*2


print(df)
```
# Practice Problem 2
```{r practice problem 2}
participant <- 1:5
rewarded <- c(650,743,429,608,588)
unrewarded <- c(728,834,503,829, 595)

reward_df <- data.frame(part = participant, reward = rewarded, unreward = unrewarded)
reward_df

reward_df$difference <- reward_df$unreward - reward_df$reward
reward_df







```
